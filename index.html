        <!-- <h1 class="dark-section-big-heading">ABOUT</h1> -->
        <p>Playing everything from the deep and dirty to the fabulously trashy, James Bowers has been packing out dancefloors for over a decade. Having honed his skills whilst ricocheting between the UK's Gay & Student scenes, he's entertained the
          likes
          of Pride queens, BBC Radio 1 nutcases and club kids with his distinctive mix of Chart Pop, Commercial Dance, House, and Club Classics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Avoiding half-measures at all costs, James Bowers has rocked crowds in excess of 1,500 clubbers at his Main Room residencies at Gatecrasher and O2 Academy venues - often sharing the stage with the likes of Scott Mills, Zane Lowe, Sara Cox,
          Gregg James, Tim Westwood, and Ms Dynamite. Sashay on over to the Gay Scene, and James Bowers can usually be found taking his captive queens to church - having performed at national Pride events and special occasions for Gay Royalty venues,
          Manchester's Cruz 101, Eagle & Via Fossa, and London's Ku Klub.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On-Air, James Bowers can be heard presenting his syndicated radio show, Hot Right Now, with extra-special mixes from HRN Residents: Dave Audé, Stonebridge, and Paul Morrell. As heard on This Is Electric & Gaydio (UK), and Nexus Radio (US),
          Hot
          Right Now has a total global reach of over 2.5 million listeners, and is also available for streaming on iTunes and Mixcloud.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside of the club, James can also be found at Manchester's prestigious School of Electronic Music, where he teaches DJing and produces dance remixes & audio content. In 2020, James Bowers was appointed Music Director at Nexus Radio (US)
          and
          charged with refining the musical identity of the station for its 2 million diverse listeners in Chicago & across the US.</p>
